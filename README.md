<h2>Mobile application development using Cordova</h2>
<p>For creating my mobile application, Cordova framework was used. Cordova is an open-source mobile development framework which allows using standard web technologies like CSS3, JavaScript and HTML5 for developing cross-platform applications. Main purpose of using this framework was to extend an application across more than one platform, without having to re-implement it with each platformâ€™s language and tool set. 
My mobile application is based on two types of users:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Administrative users.</li> 
  <li>Students of Unifi.</li>
</ul>
